## Specify the main design challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will explore the decompression/relaxation needs of the user and how to reduce one's cognitive load when watching a streaming platform. Ideally by exploring the results of these experiments will lead to a smoother and effortless interaction with streaming platforms and exploring streaming platforms as a proven stress relief and unwinding mechanism. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity touches on the userâ€™s physiological needs, social belonging and self-actualization. Physiological needs because a rejuvenated mind is necessary to one's physical health and mental health. Social belonging because shows/movies are an avenue to social interaction as well as a deeper connection to others. Lastly, self-actualization because it is an outlet to fulfill one's desire of how to become a better version of themselves.

#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions include a variety of streaming platforms but each one has its pros and cons. The needs are sometimes satisfied by these platforms or sometimes the users cognitive load is maxed out by their outlet for unwinding. 

#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Limitations of streaming platforms could be greatly improved with alterations or advancements in technology. Although they already run on digital technology there are some key issues (like bandwidth and wifi) that discourage people from relaxing in this way. 

## Target users 
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Demographic: people who have access to technology (computer/TV/wifi/etc.), people who can use technology comfortably (roughly ages 18 - 49)  
Preferences: users desire an escape from reality, a fun form of education or a creative outlet for inspiration
Expertise: ideally very low expertise, just simple knowledge of common internet icons

#### Where would the users do that activity?
Users would normally do this activity in a space in which they are comfortable. The idea is the activity reduces external stress and addition the user needs technology, so most likely in the comfort of the users home.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
The user would find a place in which they could comfortable place an electronic device and search the streaming platform for their desired show. To find a show they like, the user may search the internet to find which streaming platform it's on or they may go to their selection of streaming platforms and search there.


## Research 
I conducted participatory observation research, over the phone, with a friend who does not perfectly fit but is close to my target demographic.
