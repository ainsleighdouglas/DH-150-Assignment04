# Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
This project will explore the decompression/relaxation needs of the user and how to reduce one's cognitive load when watching a streaming platform. Ideally by exploring the results of these experiments will lead to a smoother and effortless interaction with streaming platforms and exploring streaming platforms as a proven stress relief and unwinding mechanism. 

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity touches on the userâ€™s physiological needs, social belonging and self-actualization. Physiological needs because a rejuvenated mind is necessary to one's physical health and mental health. Social belonging because shows/movies are an avenue to social interaction as well as a deeper connection to others. Lastly, self-actualization because it is an outlet to fulfill one's desire of how to become a better version of themselves.

#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions include a variety of streaming platforms but each one has its pros and cons. The needs are sometimes satisfied by these platforms or sometimes the users cognitive load is maxed out by their outlet for unwinding. 

#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Limitations of streaming platforms could be greatly improved with alterations or advancements in technology. Although they already run on digital technology there are some key issues (like bandwidth and wifi) that discourage people from relaxing in this way.
